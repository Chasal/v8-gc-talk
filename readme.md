### Are Your V8 GC Logs Speaking to You?

For my talk@Node Live Beijing, May 2016.

The GC logs are generated using [alinode](http://alinode.aliyun.com/), so they are a little bit different from the ones gerenated by the upstream(e.g. we have statistics about memory usuage in each space before the GC starts). Most of the logs are still the same though.
